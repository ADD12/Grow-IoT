# Hackathon todo!

We need backend work done. Specifically:

* Integrating and hosting a meshblu instance from the meteor app (so we can register and communicate with IoT devices)
	* We have a start at Meteor-Meshblu integration [here](https://github.com/CommonGarden/meteor-meshblu).
* Creating infrastructure for collecting and analyzing data coming in from devices (pub/sub)
* User accounts that control devices (which in turn control the growing of plants (or fish, or mushrooms, etc.)).
* *Super Stretch goal:* adding notifications.
