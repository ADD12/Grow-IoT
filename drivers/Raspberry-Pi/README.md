To build a grow-hub you will need:

* A raspberry pi of some sort (preferably a 3 for the purposes of this example).

* A T3 Tentacle hat

* Whatever atlas scientific sensors you want for it (cheaper open source options coming soon). For a hydroponics setup, we recommend:
  * pH
  * Conductivity
  * Temperature

# Grow.js on Raspberry pi

Setup your raspberry pi by following [these instructions]().

Install the latest version of Node by following [these instructions]().

Clone this repo &

`npm install`

If you want to be cool and use `yarn`... then you probably can figure it out.

# Scheduling

To make sure your schedules run on time, make sure your Raspberry pi's clock is set correctly.
