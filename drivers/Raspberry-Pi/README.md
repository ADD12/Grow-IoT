To build a grow-hub you will need:

* A raspberry pi of some sort (preferably a 3 for the purposes of this example).

* A T3 Tentacle hat

* Whatever atlas scientific sensors you want for it (cheaper open source options coming soon). For a hydroponics setup, we recommend:
  * pH
  * Conductivity
  * Temperature
