# Examples

New exmaples are welcome, please feel free to submit a PR with one (put it in a folder with the name of the device)! We are currently using [Johnny-five](http://johnny-five.io/) since it allows the same code to run on a wide variety of boards with little modification.

Currently, each example has a corresponding `.html` file in Grow-IoT `imports/examples` folder.

### Board specific tips
#### Arduino
You need to make sure that your arduino is flashed with Standard Firmata. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started#trouble-shooting).
