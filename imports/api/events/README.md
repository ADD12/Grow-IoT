# Welcome to the eventbus!
In Grow-IoT, we have things (a.k.a. event emitters) and an eventbus api for working with events!

Unfortunately, this API needs work. Some things we might consider:

+ [Time series support](https://github.com/CommonGarden/Grow-IoT/issues/211)
+ Connecting to external services or devices
+ Adding support for rules
+ REST endpoints
+ [MQTT support?](https://github.com/CommonGarden/Grow-IoT/issues/224)
+ COAP?
+ ???
